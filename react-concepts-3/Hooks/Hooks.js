// Hooks:
// Feature in React, which allows to use React features without having to write a class
// Hooks don't work with classes

// Why Hooks:
// 1. Problems with Classes:
//    1. Understand usage of this keyword is difficult.
//    2. Also, need to bind event handlers in class components
//    3. Classes don't minify very well and make hot reloading very unreliable.
// 2.


// Imp Rules for Hooks
// 1. Only call Hooks at the top level of the function: Don't call Hooks inside the loops, conditions, or nested functions
// 2. Only call Hooks from React Functions: Call them from within React functional components and not just any regular JavaScript 

// Sum up
// useState: used to manage state
